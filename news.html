            <h2>Designer Manish Malhotra throws India’s best parties. Here’s his guide to picking the perfect gift</h2>

                Manish Malhotra is to Diwali what Heidi Klum is to Halloween: its ultimate celebrity party host. Every year, the Indian fashion designer throws a star-studded Diwali bash bringing together Bollywood’s biggest names. Film legends Shah Rukh Khan and Shilpa Shetty were among the A-listers in attendance during the most recent festivities in October.

                Malhotra knows a thing or two about gifting, too. Gold may be the luxury gift traditionally exchanged during Diwali, but the designer’s luxury make-up and skincare sets — alongside festive hampers he developed for a hotel group — are just a few examples of how he appeals to Indian clientele during the country’s increasingly diverse multi-billion-dollar holiday spending spree.

            <h3>Why this matters</h3>
            <p>
                Indian fashion is, the designer said, “having its moment.” The country’s craftsmanship and textile traditions are enjoying increased international attention — and few people can take more credit than Malhotra, who attended the 2025 Met Gala, where he dressed attendees Natasha Poonawalla and Coco Jones for the red carpet.

            <p>
                “Ultimately, when I showcase Indian fashion on a global stage, I want people to see its depth, its artistry and its timelessness,” he said.
